# MUJIHotelBooking
The website we proposed is an online booking system for MUJI hotel in order to allow the visitors to book the rooms in advanced for a better-planned trip. Our idea is inspired by the hotel booking system by Hilton. To implement the website, we applied the knowledge we learned in the course including SQL database to add, edit and retrieve the data, PHP to create the form, JQuery to filter the date for available room types, and CSS to stylize the web application. We also run into some difficulties with implementing the filter the room type in terms of the dates.
